A prototype for enabling dragging and dropping of CSS elements written in CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
Simply click on the name of a shape and drag into the grey canvas.
You can then drag the new shape and place it anywhere in the canvas.
If you want to delete a shape drag it back over to the blue palette.
