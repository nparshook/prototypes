A prototype for enabling dragging and dropping of CSS elements written in CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
Simply click on the name of a shape in the blue palette and drag into the grey canvas.
You can then drag the new shape and place it anywhere in the canvas.
To edit the text inside a shape, click on the shape and then type the text you want in the shape.
If you want to delete a shape, drag it back over to the palette.
